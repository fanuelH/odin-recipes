        Make the falafel mixture: Blend half the chickpeas with 2 tbsp brine,
        spring onions, garlic, spices, salt, baking powder, flour, parsley, and
        coriander. Add the remaining chickpeas and pulse briefly to keep
        texture. Adjust consistency if needed.

        oil, lemon juice, and paprika. Add herbs and blend again. Chill until
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the falafels: Form into 14–16 balls, flatten slightly, and coat
        with flour.
